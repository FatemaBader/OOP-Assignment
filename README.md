My assignment includes lots of animation, rotating arcs, modified sin wave,
and moving text.
I used colours that work well together to enhance the overall look of
the UI as well as the use of lerped colours.
Everying was procedurally drawn.
Objects that appear similar are made from a single class.
There is a mini screen located on the far right hand side of the screen, this contains
data that would display to the user in a language only known by a human from the future.
The central stage contains a point that can be controled symbolises the users current 
location. The blue bars shine when the mouse hovers over each individual one.
